# Analyzing Amazon Electronics Sales Data with Python

## Description:

This project is a data-driven health check for an online electronics business.

It uses Python to sift through Amazon sales data to figure out what’s selling, who’s buying, and why. By turning raw numbers into visual trends, the goal is to stop guessing and start making business decisions based on actual evidence.

Key Objectives
Customer Patterns: Identifying who the big spenders are and what drives their loyalty.

Product Performance: Spotting the "best-sellers" versus the "dead stock."

Market Trends: Seeing if sales spike during specific seasons or price drops.

The Workflow
Cleaning: Scrubbing the Amazon dataset to remove errors or missing info.

Analysis: Using Python (like Pandas and Matplotlib) to calculate growth and margins.

Strategy: Using those insights to suggest better pricing or marketing tactics.

### Technologies:

Python (Data analysis and visualization)
Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)
